# arduino_serial_to_DAC_to_speaker
Play music with the Arduino received in real time on serial port.

This project (which is entirely useless and just for fun) consists in sending a 8-bit WAV file by the emulated serial port from the computer to the Arduino, while the Arduino translates in real time each byte received to 8 bits sent to the 8 resistors, which the resistor ladder transforms into a analog level sent to a speaker.

The black capacitor is 100 ÂµF, is in series with the load (the speaker), and is useed to remove the DC component (it's a best practice for speaker signals).

The blue capacitor is 100 nF from the output to the ground and it used as a low-pass filter, although I wonder it it makes a real difference in practice (the capactitor is maybe a little to small).
